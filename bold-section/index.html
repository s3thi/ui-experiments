        <h1>Rocko's Modern Life</h1>
        <p>
            Rocko lives in O-Town. Raised in Australia, Rocko later emigrated to
            the United States after he graduated high school. Murray suggests
            that Rocko's interest in the United States began with a vacation
            with his family as a youth; during the trip he met his future
            sidekick Filburt.

            <h1>Inconsistencies</h1>
            <p>
                Murray allowed for directors to create inconsistencies,
                reflecting how friends possess different and varied, nostalgic
                memories of the past.

            <h1>Fan Mail</h1>
            <p>
                For instance, in the episode "Put to Pasture" the writers
                portray Rocko, Filburt and Heffer Wolfe as students at O-Town
                High School. Murray received many pieces of mail regarding the
                storyline inconsistencies.
